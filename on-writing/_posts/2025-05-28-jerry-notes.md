Creativity in Captivity - Jerry Seinfield https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLmFq2qmh9M

# Notes:

- ART is making order out of chaos. Taking two ideas, and putting them together in a different way.

- Get things out of your way that is distracting... Bic pen + yellow legal pad pages x 10 days. All the episodes of Seinfield were written on legal paper.

- A delight a day, written by hand

- almost all pro writers write in the morning. That's when you have the energy.

- Transcedental meditation gives your brain a charge to write. You can't write at 6pm after dinner. You've got to TM first. Then you can.

- No one cares if you work. How are you going to get any work done if you have no supervision. You've gotta be the boss and the employee.

- look at it like a drone... keep looking at the topic, until you find a funny perspective

- first thing is: how are you going to bring it up? Don't waste the space... don't just bring it up. Bring it up in a funny way.

- the worse. the better. If life sucks? It can be used.
