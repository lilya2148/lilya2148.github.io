1. "Prove that you're a bad writer" Dan Harmon
2. "The important thing to remember is that as a would-be, could-be, or should-be writer, you have the edge. A writer doesn't have to sell [themselves]. Their pages speak for themselves. All you need is the right person to read them." - Ed Simmons
3. "In the practical sense only you can teach yourself to write with your own writing, writing, and more writing." Gene Perret
