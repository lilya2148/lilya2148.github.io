Awareness by Anthony De Mello

What I'm trying to get out of this book: 
I read an excerpt that talked about depression, and it seemed like it had some valuable insights. When I find it I'll put it here. But the concept was that you're only depressed when you're allowing yourself to be pre-occupied. Happiness comes from losing yourself. I thought that was true, and useful, and I wanted some more.
