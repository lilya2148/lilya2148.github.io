title: "Three Decision Paths"
---
These are the decision making paths. There are three that offer different futures and they’re to give you a way about envisioning your future.
1. The path we’d get current state. Status who or incremental improvement path. You keep going as you’re going or you make small improvements.
2. The radical shift! You go a completely different direction. Bold, destructive, re-imagination.
3. The forgotten path: the "third" path. Creative and emergent - one that balances insights from the first two, or approaches the problem form a totally different perspective. It's not a compromise, but a synthesis or lateral leap.
