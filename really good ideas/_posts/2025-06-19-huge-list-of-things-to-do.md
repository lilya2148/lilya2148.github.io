Intro?: Alright. This list is an experiment like this whole freaking site, lol. Here's a list of things that I thought... at one point... yo... You should do this

# Todo list

- [ ] go to church x 4 w/ s
- [ ] Watch Shane Gillis on a podcast 
- [ ] ask yourself: who are the people in different stages of your life that you have admired? 
- [ ] go to an open mic and just ask chatgpt to make you jokes. Then read them and say funny or not funny
- [ ] start writing at noon from work - go to the park and write for an hour! (Discipline!)
