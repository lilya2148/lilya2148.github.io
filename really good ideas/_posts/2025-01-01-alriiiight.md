Here's a list of good ideas: 

1) it's a hard question, but it's one you *shooould* know the answer too. Ask your partner or your friend or anyone you have a relationship with: what's the worst part about being in a relationship with me? 

2) high buy - it's when you get high and then buy something. When you're high, you're more connected to your inner self. You can feel your feet again. You haven't felt your foot since you were like 1 years old and felt the earth for the first time. Your purchases will set you on a course towards your true desires. It'll be instructive for your not high self. 

3) What negative experiences might I experience today? Plan it out. Write down what's gonna be notta fun. 

4) What was the worst thing that happened today? Why was it awful? What, if anything, could have made it better?
