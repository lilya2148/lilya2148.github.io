# NOTES
If you are going to make stylist / code changes; make a branch, homie

otherwise if shit breaks, you're sorta screwed

# How To Publish to this site:

1) add a post to the home page (index.markdown), 

2) `git add .`, `git commit -m 'a silly lil commit'`, `git push`. Note: You could just maintain at github if you wanted to! No need to do command line stuff!

3) look at your changes here: https://lilya2148.github.io/
