Okay soooo it turns out there are some things that are kind of ... unexpected. 

If you want your post to be published:  
- date should be YYYY-MM-DD in the filename  
- the date should be correct in your file  
- the date and datetime shouldn't be the same as any other file  
- the date shouldn't be in the future (and/or... this is how you can schedule post...!)
