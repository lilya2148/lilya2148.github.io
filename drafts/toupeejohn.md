SKETCH
Narrator: Men are balding like crazy. It's bad. They feel bad. They're not as funny. They're not as charming. And only one thing can save them. It's not hats. It's not HIMs balding serum. It's not even that head massage thing that physically stimulates hair follicles, basically saying like, GET THE FUCK UP. GROW! 

None of these things will work. 

The only thing that will work? TOUPEE JOHN. 

TOUPEE JOHN smiles into the camera. 

TOUPEE JOHN will make your uncle look like he did when he went to Vietnam. 

TOUPEE JOHN high fives an older man, with a full head of curly brown hair. It's way too shiny 

Scene opens with a toupee shop montage. Guys are going in bald, and leaving with a full head of hair. Everyone is smiling and happy. There are some diagonal camera shots. 


Man in the Chair is all but bald on the top of his head. He has a flappy little wisp of hair on his forehead. He looks back and talks the the Barber. Who nods and smiles approvingly. He knows what he's doing here. He's done it all day. Men come in looking like 50 year olds and leave looking like they're in college and sleeping.
