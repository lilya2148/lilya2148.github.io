title: the rich church
---
Should the church be rich? When did the church become rich? Was that a good thing? How could it be good for the church to be rich when one of it's core tenants is to be in solidarity with the poor. Isn't that the most 

Help me. I feel like I'm falling here. What's the thing that's going on, then I can provide some help. Well sure sure sure... Yeah I can help you. I don't think you should have any money. that's the problem we're struggling with. I don't think it's healthy. I think it's a sin. 

What if we all go to hell? Hm? If we don't go to hell now then we won't go to heaven. Isn't that right. You meet the Buddha in hell. At least we're writing now. This won't make me any money. GOOD! What're we doing it for. Ah this is trouble now. The trouble is: I am not motivated to make money because I think money is the devil. UH OH. No wonder you're a popper. Freaking hell dude that's such a bummer. Well? How could I be rich? I look at houses and aI hate them. They represent inequity. They represent oppression - if not explicitly, then... well? Implicitly. The have and the havenots. We have stuff. They don't. That's a problem. Is it? Sort of, right? It's a problem for them when they're cold and they can't think of anything other than eating something. It's a problem for them when they ugh ugh ugh. Why am i doing this? Why is this on my heart? Well? At least you have a heart. No that's not right. I don't understand how one can be rich and be a servant of the lord. And is that even what I'm trying for? TO be a servant of the lord. If I *were* trying to do that wouldn't i be doing like about a hundred million things differently? Wouldn't I be making a hundred sandwiches? I think so. I think I got to make those sandwiches. FRICK. I mean some people don't have the time or money ot go to the store. I don't know what to do. I mean... 

But isn't it also such a waste to just shovel in volunteers and have them serve food from behind a soup kitchen line. Isn't that insane?
