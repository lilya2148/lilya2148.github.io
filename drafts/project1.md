# General Idea
Okay, I want to practice writing jokes. I want something funny to write everyday. Wake up, know what the funny project is. You can also post these on IG, which makes it pretty good. It'll be a writing-forward IG, too, which is even better. 

# Reward
You can get a new hoodie. 

# Dumb / Visionary idea of what we're doing
Hell yeah brother, this part is easy. This is what I was made for. The dumb (and by dumb, I mean visionary?) piece of this is: we write every day. We get up, we get coffee, we write. Boom. Already a winner. We're writing jokes. The jokes are hard-core. The jokes are so funny, someone offers you a million dollars. 

No, but you know what you do have? This super funny card deck - and I mean super funny - and now (there's 52 of them). Each of them have about 60 words of them. And yeah... that's 3000 words... and maybe you write 4-5 x per card. That'd be cool. Anyway. You have this big deck of cards. You put it on your website. Boom. Now you have something online you can sell... You can put that up there today, bb. You can get that online, within, an instant. And the funny thing is? It's just practice. You'll be getting better every day. Amazing. You're going to get amazing. It'll be incredible. Then? You can re-write the 48 laws of power as a joke. That'll be really funny.

You could also recreate the examen app -- but just do like... 20 examens... I think.. I think you can do that.
