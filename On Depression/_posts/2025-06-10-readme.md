I made this blog to write about things that I'm interested in - depression is one of those! A couple notes, because writing is scary, and writing about depression – at least for me– is scarier.

1. If you're struggling with depression, you could see a pro! I hope this is helpful, but I'm no pro... 
2. I might not even be a player. Am I depressed? I don't *think* so but there's certainly data... Still feels like one of those things where you'd know. So, sure, I’m a faker, is I guess what I’m saying. Which brings us to:
3. Then why are you writing this, dickhead? Great question! See what I mean? I’ve got some voices in here that are unkind. There are voices, smh, makes me sound like I’m *super* crazy. 
4. My b there - probably doesn't make sense to bring you into "this" 
5. Also maybe a little insensitive to refer to a kind of person that I could be: a totally crazy person. Which I'm explicitly saying that I don't want to be. 
5. I'm probably projecting, but if i were to suss a vibe, I would say, you're loving this. 

### Why have this section
I've struggled with something, I don't know if you would call it depression, I don't know if I would call it depression or if the DSM-5 would call it depression. But somedays for sure, I have thoughts like: 
- this is meaningless
- I don't want to live the day I lived today, again, tomorrow
- I am trapped in my own head. 

Usually, I just live like that until it goes away on it's own accord. It doesn't stick with me for days and days and days, but it usually shows up once a day, at least for a sec, to drop in. To say hello. And some days, it's the only thing that's there. So yeah. It could be way worse. 

But! It's still not fun! And I wanted to write about it to: 
a) catalogue ideas that have helped me and keep some sense of what I've tried and what I haven't tried, what works, what doesn't work, etc etc. and  
b) try to figure it out! 

I feel like there's a lot of sort of advice otu there on what to do when you're feeling... depressed. And some of it straight up WORKS and some of it does not work at all... How can that be?? Why isn't there a once and for all formula? Not sure, but that's for me, what makes it so interesting.
