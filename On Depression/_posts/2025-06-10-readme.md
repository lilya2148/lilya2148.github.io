I made this blog to write about things that I'm interested in - depression is one of those! But before going anywhere, note: I'm not a pro. If you are struggling with depression, you could see a pro! This is sort of my own log of thoughts around depression; things that have helped me, things that sound good, but don't work; things that sound bad but work, etc... so I hope it will be helpful for anyone who is depressed or is in a depressive state, buuut I'm not a professional or a psychologist or anything really. 


## Background for me
I've struggled with something, I don't know if you would call it depression, I don't know if I would call it depression or if the DSM-5 would call it depression. But somedays for sure, I have thoughts like: 
- this is meaningless
- I don't want to live the day I lived today, again, tomorrow
- I am trapped in my own head. 

Usually, I just live like that until it goes away on it's own accord. It doesn't stick with me for days and days and days, but it usually shows up once a day, at least for a sec, to drop in. To say hello. And some days, it's the only thing that's there. So yeah. It could be way worse. 

But! It's still not fun! And I wanted to write about it to: 
a) catalogue ideas that have helped me and keep some sense of what I've tried and what I haven't tried, what works, what doesn't work, etc etc. and  
b) try to figure it out! 

I feel like there's a lot of sort of advice otu there on what to do when you're feeling... depressed. And some of it straight up WORKS and some of it does not work at all... How can that be?? Why isn't there a once and for all formula? Not sure, but that's for me, what makes it so interesting.
