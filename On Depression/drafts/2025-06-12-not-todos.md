title: "Things that might make you depressed"
---
1. Never be sober - when you're sober, you're attached to real life, which is depressing. Detatch, dissociate. 
2. Get as much information about the world and all the ways that it's fucked up as you can. 
3. Learn about the variety of ways that civilization could end: famine, meteor, nuke fest, pandemic, totalitarianism.
