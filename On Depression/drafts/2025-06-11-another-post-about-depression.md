title: "Don't think about it too much"
---
I’ve heard you say that depression is just a feeling. 

That it’s not who you are. You said that it’ll pass just like any other feeling, but I’ve noticed that this feeling keeps coming back, and it’s debilitating each time it comes. It's overwhelming and-- I’ll say it!-- it’s depressing and makes me feel like my life is wrong and that I’ve messed up somehow. Makes me sorry for myself. And then disgusted at myself for being sorry for myself. "Don't you know it could be so much worse? You should be grateful." It makes me wonder if I should’ve done things differently. It makes me look at the people I surround myself and wonder if I could have had different friendshsips, stronger friendships if I kept that job, stayed in that city, reached out more. 

It makes me wonder if they're enough for me, and then rif I'm enough for them. And it reminds me that I will *lose* the people I *do* love if I don't snap out of this feeling already, so snap out of it and go do a workout or do something; you can’t think your way out of depression. You’ve got a move. There’s no use problems solving when you're like this.


You shouldn't be thinking about yourself. Life is happening for you. 

I've heard that you are *not* your feelings. You are not depression. It is a feeling that is moving through you. It is a thiing that is happening to you. You are NOT your depression. There simply *is* depression. But there is depression, so often. There almost always is depression. Or if it is not there, then it is coming b
Depression is like
You’re not depressed, you are not your 
depression
It will pass
Yeaaahhh but you know what won’t pass? All the conditions about my life that are making me sad- I wouldn’t live today again. Yet tomorrow, I will
I even bought myself a cookie and a coke and a sandwich 
Still, I was sad
