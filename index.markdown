### on dedicating your life to God?

The first time I wrote out here I didn't have any idea what I would write about. It was sort of a weird feeling, like getting off an airplane and not knowing what country you're in. 

That's never happened to me. That would be crazy. 

The events that would have to occur for that to happen would be... weird. I think the most likely thing is, you'd be kidnapped, right? But also, then, well. The implication of the premise is that you can sort of get out and explore on your own. Like you're going to have to work to figure out what country you are in, and that means that you probably aren't been pulled around by some kidnappers or anything. So maybe you got kidnapped, and then all of your kidnappers, except the pilot, died on the plane. And you're stepping out into a new country...

The question of dedicating my life to God feels like the same question as: what's the most meaningful and service-ful work that I can do? For me, my head goes to: how can you dedicate your life to the poor. Probably got to give everything away. Like, if you're dedicating your life to the poor, you probably can't go skiing anymore, right? The poor don't ski, soooo I feel like you probably also don't get to ski. 

TOTAL BUMMER! Totally not worth it! Give it all away? I mean, yeah, right? If I'm skiing, I probably spent money on a plane ticket, money on my skis, money on my ski pass... Probably upwards of like $1k to go skiing. And all of that money could have been donated to a guy named Joe to put him in a motel for a week. Or maybe it's just to keep a family off the street for a couple nights, and turns out, that's all they need in order to STAY off the street. I should find it, but there's a sort of crazy stat out there that's like... this is how likely it is for you to get off the street based on how long you've been out there. From what I understand, if you're on the street for more than 3 months, you're going to be there for a while. All to say: there's some incentive to get people out of that position quickly. 

Is this what God was talking about when he said the rich are going to have such a hard time getting into the kingdom of heaven? I lost my phone the other day and sort of freaked out, like, WHAT IF I LOSE ALL MY MONEEEY. And when I finally got my phone back, I (thought I) heard a little voice saying, "So it seems to me you still care a good deal about money, is that right?" 

And yeah! I freaking do! But isn't there that one verse about talents? Thank God there's that one verse about talents. Don't let your talents just sit there! Grow! Invest you talents! Make more... talents! Make more money! Your God gave you value, now make more value! Ah, it's the rich person's dream. The whole incentive for a field of Christian millionaires to say, "No no... I'm allowed to have money." 

And aren't you? I guess, what I'm getting at, is this. For me? It seems like it's God's will to take care of the most vulnerable. I.e. the poor, right? So what am I sitting in this house for? Getting ready to go to work, about to *brew* coffee with my coffee maker to drink in a *ceramic mug* to sit at a *computer* to do work to make *money* for people who already have *money*.
