My Big Head

Thank you for being the one
Who told me I mattered more 
And to just let the boogie board go 
Because we can always get another one but we can’t get another you
For putting that image in my brain so early
Walmart cardboard cut-outs of each of us
No such thing
Alone - the only ones here
And not for very long at all
So don’t die
Because your head was so freaking big
Baseball

Thank you for being the one
To escape the house alone with me
To the fields by the lake where they stock fish
Where joey told me
Keep your eye on the bobber
When I couldn't stop talking
You taught me pretty much everything else
Every argument just something I hadn’t learned yet 
And hoped weren’t true
The most recents being that I should study computer science
And stay in consulting
That I may be good at it
Thank you for making us both care about something
Just so we could escape the house alone together
My First 

thank god thank god thank god you exist
One of my twins
Do I have many, because of you?
The first person, maybe,
who showed me what it meant 
to be no matter what 
always there
Never going to let you down, goddammit, goddammit

Even when we were just kids
You told me: depressed, I think
Driving up Tar Hollow
(So we must’ve been close)
I went full flight or fight
Not the first time
And listened and tried to ask questions
And so continued the not short story of
holding each other through life
