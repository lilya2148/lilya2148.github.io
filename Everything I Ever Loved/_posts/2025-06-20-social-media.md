So, hot take. Instagram, Tiktok… all the social medias. They’re pretty cool.

I mean for sure, they are ruining us. But come one, Instagram is beautiful.

People are putting their funniest, smartest, most thought-out, edited, coolest, selves on this thing, and we get to watch that? Whoa. That’s a lot of cool people doing cool things. That’s nice. 

I watch Kobe talking about doubt, then I watch someone juggle bowling pins while going down the side of a mountain in skis. What?! I go back to Kobe, this time with Jimmy Kimmel: I watch that clip of Kimmel reading out Kobe’s Facebook post after he tore his achilles. At some point, if I wanted to see a famous person speak, I’d have to like, be there. And now, I’m just on my couch listening to anything anyone ever said on camera.

And Sam Harris - yeah, agreed. Social media is ruining society. I am also ruined by it. But it is also - entrancing and magical and creative. The content is great! Occasionally! It can be awful, but it can be really freaking good. In some ways, I am hopeful that we are actually taking over the algorithm. That we are not being ruined; we’re too good to ever rot.

Like, I just watched someone playing the piano while paragliding. I never would have been able to see that ever, unless I was literally paragliding behind him. Or I guess I could have seen it from the ground, but come on, that’s way different than seeing it up close.

I log onto instagram, and I hear that Italy is offering people to buy homes in Tuscany for super cheap. All I have to do is live there. I mean…

People tell me how to make $$$ on instagram. People tell me how to be less sad. People tell me how to cook great steaks. And now I can cook steak pretty well! People tell me everything. They dance, play me songs, tell me jokes. It’s CRAZY out here. It’s so incredibly amazing, and I love it, and all of my friends aren’t talking to me anymore, but it’s, I mean. It’s really a good thing.
