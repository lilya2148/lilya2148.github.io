It's strange to me that once I make that category, it will be put on the website. 

Half of me writing here is just getting comfortable, I think, with the fact that someone, somewhere could read this. I think I *could* have a poetry side of this, which would be fun... I mean... yeah... this is like... my space! I can do whatever I want in here! Ah! Super freedom! 

Alright, here's some background. I've been "trying" to be a "writer" for what, like... 5 years now? After I graduated college, I took a writing class, that was probably the first of it. 2018. Then I started trying to publish things in various places, like McSweeney's. Then I worked for a year, then I took a leave of absence to work at a deli and try to write a book. I wrote 100k pages. Oh, my gawd! Yeah it was super long. And it wasn't that good. And I didn't show it to nobody. It was crazy. I dunno... I freakiing... Yeah. Just did it. 

Since then, I've tried to do a bunch of things. I've had a bunch of jobs like: 
- marketer
- gm of a sports team
- lead of comms for a sports team
- CTO of a startup
- just a rego developer
- tried doing standup
- tried to be a freelance writer / journalist
- tried to be more of an essayist / poet

And the truth is - what's the truth are you asking? Are you reading this, and saying: "Yeaaah, but what is it, you know... the truth?" The truth is, I think I want to be all of these things, just a little bit. I want to be an entrepreneur who decides his own work, and sometimes writes and sometimes like... organizes shit for toher people (events? charity events?) I want to talk about philosophy and religion, and God, and I want to make people laugh. I want to free people up, too. I want them to feel like... this is my day, not just some sort of day that I woke up into. And I can slowly feel my possible realities shutting off. Powering down, like rooms in a warehouse that don't get used anymore. Totally forgotten until someone decides to clean it all out. 

And there's a sense of urgency there. Like I *know* I need to keep the light on in these rooms, or else they're going to haunt me, in some way, I think! So what's the path forward? I'm not even sure... I'm so spread out, and discombobulated. It feels like nothing I do is really moving the needle forward. And what's the needle? I'm not even sure! 

# Possible Categories on this Site
First - before I get into the categories (GET ON WITH IT). 

Some categories:
- projects (deadlines, ideas, visions, etc)
- entrepreneurship (on making $$)
- On Giving
- on making comedy


okay, here's an idea... we do this every day... 
we get up, we work for 2hrs (ish)
we make a post to IG, because we need to do that every day for 6 months or something
we make something to sell at some point
we write stuff.

- we have a project we are working towards... This one is going to be writing out affirmations
We set a deadline projects... we can have a project list...
