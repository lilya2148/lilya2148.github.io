### Ingredients
- 2lb salmon
- 16 oz feta cheese
- head of garlic
- broccoli
- onion 
- pasta
- basil + red pepper flakes 

### Steps
1. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Into a large ovenproof skillet or large baking dish, place the salmon, tomatoes, and feta cheese. Drizzle everything with olive oil, and season the salmon and tomatoes with some salt and pepper (be careful with the salt because feta is already quite salty).  
2. Place the dish in the oven and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until the tomatoes are bursting and the feta is golden on top.  
3. Make pasta
4. Stir the salmon and veggies with a fork. 
5. Add the basil, garlic, and red pepper flakes to the sauce, and stir.  
6. Finally, add the pasta and stir to combine. Add the pasta water to thin the sauce, if necessary.  

### Thoughts
whoa baby 16oz feta was aaaay too much... needed more veggies!! probably should have put in spinach at some point...
