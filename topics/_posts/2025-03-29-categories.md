## Existing topics 
*and a short description of why I'm including them as topics*
1. categories -- so meta... don't need to read it unless you want to. Sort of a stupid joke. 
2. books -- every book has a question I want to ask it. Or I ask it: "take me away from this reality." 
3. depression -- how to live good
4. humor -- always wanted to be funny - lil word jokes
5. on writing -- how to do this! better
6. projects -- what is "this"
7. really good ideas -- what "this" could be...
8. substack millionaire -- one of the things "this" is
9. workouts -- gotta be fit
10. the making of this blog -- "this"
