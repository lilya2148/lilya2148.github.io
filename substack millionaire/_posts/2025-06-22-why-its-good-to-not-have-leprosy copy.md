Happy III.II.I whatever day of the week it is today!

Here are 3 ideas, 1 question, and 2 quotes from strangers to consider this week...


# 3 Ideas From Me
I.

“Driving back from the airport, there was a saxophonist playing at a red light. He stood in front of 3 lanes of cars, played his saxophone, and then bowed.”

​II.

“Cut the brownie in half until you can’t anymore.”

III.

“When you’re no good at something, just say you’re rusty. Rusty implies former mastery. ‘Hey you want to come to a party?’ I would, but I’m a little rusty at the whole party scene. Makes it seem like one day, not so far ago, you were a gamer. You partied like tomorrow wasn’t going to come, but it did come and you just kept partying anyway.”

​II.

“I didn’t write anything ‘good’ at all until my early 30’s, despite writing for most of my life and getting an undergraduate AND graduate degree in it. I published my first book in 2018 at 34. My next book comes out in January, when I’ll be 41. I have four other projects in various stages that I hope to sell and publish throughout my 40’s, and I have no idea what I’ll work on in my 50’s (and beyond).”
