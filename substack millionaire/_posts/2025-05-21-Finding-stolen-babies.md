​II.

“Alex Hormozi’s whole thing is like, work so hard that luck becomes a non factor. Which is great advice. ‘Do the work; work harder than everybody. And you’ll make it.’ Can’t argue with that! But what about the potato guy? I want advice from the guy who made a million dollars mailing potatoes with notes drawn into them.”

III.

“Once I bought a rotisserie chicken and a sick pack from Whole Foods, and the checkout screen asked if I was dining in. Do this.”

# 2 Quotes From Strangers
I.

“You don’t have to be Steve Irwin for everything, but you should be Steve Irwin about something.”

​II.

“Remember when you were a kid? A part of living for sure is remembering moments you were alive. It doesn’t make you less alive to remember those moments. And there will be a time when you don’t remember anything. And then, you will be dead.”

Source: Alan Rickman


# 1 Question For You
Ask ppl: “Is this your baby?” If it is, congratulate them. If it isn’t then wtf. If they’re babysitting, apologize for being so suspicious and intrusive. Walk away. If they’re not babysitting, though? Wtf again. But more so.
