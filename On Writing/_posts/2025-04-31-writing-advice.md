1. "Prove that you're a bad writer" Dan Harmon
2. "The important thing to remember is that as a would-be, could-be, or should-be writer, you have the edge. A writer doesn't have to sell [themselves]. Their pages speak for themselves. All you need is the right person to read them." - Ed Simmons
3. "In the practical sense only you can teach yourself to write with your own writing, writing, and more writing." Gene Perret
4. "I'm writing a first draft and reminding myself that I'm simply shoveling sand into a box so that I can later build sandcastles." Shannon Hale
5. Pretend YOU are ChatGPT and then have the determination or the will power to just DO what you’re asking/wanting. It’ll be a function of willpower, which is a con, but trick yourself into it!. 
6. "Write a short story every week. It's not possible to write 52 bad short stories in a row.” -- Ray Bradbury

8. I like what I like, and you like what you like, and art is the place where liking what we like, over and over, is not only allowed, but is the essential skill. How emphatically can you like what you like? How long are you willing to work on something to ensure that every bit of it gets infused with some trace of your radical preference? The choosing, the choosing, that’s all we’ve got.” - George Saunders  
9. “This writer may bear little resemblance to the writer we dreamed of being. She is born, for better or worse, out of that which we really are: the tendencies we’ve been trying, all these years, in our writing and maybe even in our lives, to suppress or deny or correct, the parts of ourselves of which we might even feel a little ashamed.” - George Saunders

1. Work on one thing at a time until finished.
2. Start no more new books, add no more new material to ‘Black Spring.’
3. Don’t be nervous. Work calmly, joyously, recklessly on whatever is in hand.
4. Work according to Program and not according to mood. Stop at the appointed time!​
5. When you can’t create you can work.
6. Cement a little every day, rather than add new fertilizers.
​7. Keep human! See people, go places, drink if you feel like it.
​8. Don’t be a draught-horse! Work with pleasure only.
​9. Discard the Program when you feel like it—but go back to it next day. Concentrate. Narrow down. Exclude.​
​10. Forget the books you want to write. Think only of the book you are writing.
​11. Write first and always. Painting, music, friends, cinema, all these come afterwards.
