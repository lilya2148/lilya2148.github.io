title: rules for writing for now

What's up. I want to put down some of my own rules for writing
a) to solidify some of the habits I've started to make and 
b) to have something to come back to in times of despair.

I also started [a big list of writing advice](https://lilya2148.github.io/on%20writing/2025/05/01/writing-advice.html). I felt like there were so many people / blogs / billboards / posts telling me what I should be doing in order to _be_ a writer and some of it I think was really good advice. This is essentially my own selection from that, as well as potentially unadvisable rules that work for me but are weird. 

### things to do on repeat
1. Yearly, make a rough project plan that goes quarter by quarter and what you might work towards in those quarters
2. Quarterly, review the plan for that quarter, add some detail, add some concrete goals you'd like to hit
3. Monthly, set goals + todos
4. Weekly, on Monday, review the past week (how'd it go? why?), list out all the things you want to accomplish this week. Try to choose the highest impact items and work on that. 
5. Weekly, also on Monday, add content to be posted to your 3 content streams (IG, IG, substack) for the next 10 days. IG should have 10 posts, substack should have 1. 

### Principles
- make it easy, fun, enjoyable (Atomic Habitzzz)
- juuuust make it exist, then make it better
- it should be fun...!!

### Current Routine
I've gone through a lot of iterations of "writing" routines. I still feel like I need to write every day in order to build up some discipline + confidence that I'm I'm going to do the thing I say I'm going to do. I'm aiming to write an hour or two in the morning before work. I've loosened up a bit! I used to have a todo list of like 7-8 things to hit every morning (brush teeth, drink water were on there). 

To make it enjoyable + fun, I write by a river, on my computer, with coffee. All these things make writing easy/fun/enjoyable for me. I love being outside in the morning with coffee, and the spot I go to is so beautiful! I also have wifi here, which is nice, because I like to work out of Google docs, and make posts/updates to this site. 

I write for 10-15 minutes in DayOne (I used the free version). This is my warmup / morning pages.... I try to not write for more than 750 words and my LIMIT LIMIT is 1000. I would spend all morning just beebopping my journal thoughts, but that's not very productive, is it. The stuff that I'm writing in there is so unpolished and random, it's not really usable. 

Next, I consult my list for the week, and start working! I try to write for 2 hours a day, but this has been hard for me! Usually, I'll write from 710 or so to 830, when I have to start getting ready for work.

The remaining 30min-60min of writing I do at lunch. I also have an outdoor spot near my work that is pretty and in the shade and sometimes someone even comes by and plays a little jazz! I let myself warm-up again in DayOne (still trying to keep my total daily entry <750 words and definitely under 1000) and then I continue working on one of the tasks for the week.

I am trying to write for 2 hours a day - or 40 hours a month. I like tracking it at the monthly level, and was suprised at how much of a difference this made for me. When tracking hours per week, I always felt like I was behind from the minute I started on Monday. Every day felt like it was crucial to hit my minutes. When I'm tracking monthly, I get that slow-build dopamine pull as I get closer and closer to my monthly goal. It feels way less "AHHH I need to get my hours in!!" and way more "look how much I'm writing!" 

2 hours a day is still a stretch for me, but it also feels like it's got to be my base. [Marie Forleo](https://www.marieforleo.com/) once said: "If you can't commit to 2 hours a day, then, uh... what're you doing?!?!" Okay she didn't say that exactly, but it was sort of like that. And honestly, I buy into it! 2 hours a day towards your business or project is still only 10 hours a week... that's got to be the base! When you're starting out, you're up against people who have done this for years AND do it for more like 30-40 hours a week. How are you going to compete with them if they're doing in a week what you're doing in a month!? 

Realistically, I think 4-6 hrs of work per day is my max for high output, lots-of-thinking tasks. So I guess my eventual goal is to make it to like 80 - 120 hours a month. But that also might have to wait until this thing is a full time job. 

If everything went right in a week, I think I could do 2 hours in the mornings, 1 hour at lunch, 15-30 minutes adhoc throughout the day, and 30 minutes after dinner. Then on the weekends I could do anywhere from 2-4 hours a day. So all in all, a _perfect_ week (where I don't have many social plans / adventures on the weekends or after work), would be around 4 x 7 = 28 hours. Pretty good! 

### Outliers + Weird stuff
I'm big into planning apparently. I *do* count my planning time as writing, but I try to keep it minimal. If this is my business, it's not like my PM is going to be a non-paid employee. We gotta do it, and we gotta pay for it. It's important work! But - I do like to informally timebox this by keeping a constant mantra of "I should be *writing*, writing" whenever I'm making a plan. Same goes with other business tasks... I count it as writing time, and trust that if it's on my list, it's important enough to need to get done. This includes setting up social media accounts / scheduling tools, creating an LLC, and website (coding) updates. 

On Writing On Writing - how meta can we get here. Look, if it's writing, and I like it, I'm going to do it. Even if it's just about how I write. Even if it's about bananas. I'm pretty attentive to what projects are FUN!!! and what projects I thought would be fun, and actually suck. If a project I thought would be FUNN!! actually sucks... then I try to make a note to not do that kind of work in the future. For me, writing and thinking about process has always been fun. So I indulge. Also, I love to go meta. I allow it! 

### Current Mantra: Just Make It Exist. 
From none other than the substack of Caitlin Kunkel, my personal hero and guide: "Sometimes, making it exist is all that matters, and then you move into making it good." (from: [Writing is a Game of Attrition](https://inputandoutput.substack.com/p/writing-is-a-game-of-attrition))

This has really helped me to CHILLOUT whenever I write. Usually, no matter what I'm writing, I'll get to a point where something inside me says, "THIS FREAKING SUCKS - UGHHH HORSE CRAP! THIS IS HORSE CRAP!" Not super fun to get that kind of self talk... so that's where I've been trying to just remember that existing is *way* better than not existing. So anything written is really a huge improvement.
