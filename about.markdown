Hello there, 

First - thanks for coming to this page! It's a weirdo of a little project, and it's fun to have it up on the interewbs. 

Second to last, a few, quick notes on how this site was hosted (github pages) and built (quickstart from [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)). Okay that's it! If you have trouble re-creating, feel free to email me at lilyarnar1@gmail.com. 

Totally Last: notes for ME! On how to publish to this site. Simply add a post to the home page (index.markdown), `git add .`, `git commit -m 'a silly lil commit'`, `git push`. Note: You could just maintain at github if you wanted to! No need to do command line stuff!
