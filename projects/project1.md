A Note on making a project document: This should take no longer than an hour, I think...

# General Idea
Okay, I want to practice writing jokes. I want something funny to write everyday. Wake up, know what the funny project is. You can also post these on IG, which makes it pretty good. It'll be a writing-forward IG, too, which is even better. We're recreating a deck of cards, so it's simple and actionable

# Reward
You can get a really nice hoodie

OR

You can get a new piece of clothing - a new hoodie, lulu shorts / nice black shorts

OR

You can get 3 books like, Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Rich Dad Poor Dad (LOL) and .... idk waht else... 

OR 

You can get a record player

# Dumb / Visionary idea of what we're doing
Hell yeah brother, this part is easy. This is what I was made for. The dumb (and by dumb, I mean visionary?) piece of this is: we write every day. We get up, we get coffee, we write. Boom. Already a winner. I'm already a successful writing PRO. We're writing jokes. The jokes are hard-core. The jokes are so funny, someone offers you a million dollars. 

No, but you know what you do have? This super funny card deck - and I mean super funny - and now (there's 52 of them). Each of them have about 60 words of them. And yeah... that's 3000 words... and maybe you write 4-5 x per card. That'd be cool. Anyway. You have this big deck of cards. You put it on your website. Boom. Now you have something online you can sell... You can put that up there today, bb. You can get that online, within, an instant. And the funny thing is? It's just practice. You'll be getting better every day. Amazing. You're going to get amazing. It'll be incredible. Then? You can re-write the 48 laws of power as a joke. That'll be really funny. 
The 50 Big Dick Laws of Unlimited Power. 

You could also recreate the examen app -- but just do like... 20 examens... I think.. I think you can do that. 

# Smart Goals
## Measurable: 
- recreate the affirmators deck. 
- write 5 of each card (roughly 60 words per card)
- pick the best one 

## Achievable: 
- writing an hour every day, I can make 10 cards / 260. 
- about 15,600 words total
- 600 words per day for 26 days == 15,600 (just under 6 weeks)

## Relevant: 
- Joke-writing practice! 
- It'll give you *endless* material to put on IG
- You can sell it!

## Timebound: 
- April 1 to May 9
- DEADLINE: May 8th at midnight

# Signature
Scope creep? I'm already thinking about doing the examen... I'm already thinking about, well? Do you want to post to IG as *well* as write these out? How are you going to manage that? What about the design? Who is going to do the cartoon? 

But no - we have it here! WE're ready to roll. Tomorrow we begin. Actually? Today we - no! yesterday! I started this thing yesterday! So leggo.
