title: "First year of work"
---
This is your first year of work. You've got the permission to not know what the HELL is going on. You've got a bunch of people telling you what to do, saying: You should do X! Or Y! Or Z! But this is just your first year. You don't know what's the right thing to do! 

hang out with your boss a bit! get to know them!

make a list of all the advice you've ever been given.. 

make something super lovy dovy and put it on a t-shirt thatâ€™s HARD dude... make in black on black or blue on blue - make it like hard to read... make it embroidered... 
and make it like... love big my guy 
or 
god is in your nose
or
and do all sorts of like: HARD dudez kind of getting it right kind of messaging but for soft things like: 
the thing you can control is your ability to affect positive change

# January - March (Q1)
Sooo... what did I do? Not much. I made this blog. I made a space for myself to publish things anonymously too. Great. Nice. 

I also wrote a short story. Note: fiction should be a part of this blog. You should have a page for fiction. 

# April - June (Q2)
This has been my favorite quarter so far. I feel like I was able to really ramp up in Q2. I wrote for 30 hours in June (huge!) I wrote an affirmators card deck, put 25 posts on this blog, set up stripe, wrote 3 substacks, and wrote a lot of drafts for essays and funny things.
