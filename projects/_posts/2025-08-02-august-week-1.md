### Hope
I hope I can knock out a lot of this early in the week! And then start to do some admin tasks. If I did everything on the OG list I'd be happy. 

### Review
Alriiight - so yeah, I did everything on the OG list, but I did it a day late. Sort of. Forgot when I was making this list that I was going to be on vacation from Wed-Sun. So... really didn't get anything done on those days. All things considered, I'm sort of stoked that I got what I got done when I did. If I'd had a regular week, that means I'd probably would have been done on like Wednesday. You also made a program to make writing new posts so freaking easy. So that's pretty neat as well. 

All in all - and yes, I think I'll be a little verbose here - it was an okay week. After vacation, and during vacation, I had the feeling of "oh god no, what the fuck am I doing" rather than the sort of... growing feeling that I'm an artist, and I'm discovering what kinds of things I want to be making, and all that. I did find these quotes from a friend! 
- “I like what I like, and you like what you like, and art is the place where liking what we like, over and over, is not only allowed, but is the essential skill. How emphatically can you like what you like? How long are you willing to work on something to ensure that every bit of it gets infused with some trace of your radical preference? The choosing, the choosing, that’s all we’ve got.” - George Saunders  
- “This writer may bear little resemblance to the writer we dreamed of being. She is born, for better or worse, out of that which we really are: the tendencies we’ve been trying, all these years, in our writing and maybe even in our lives, to suppress or deny or correct, the parts of ourselves of which we might even feel a little ashamed.” -- George  
- “This is a big moment for any artist (this moment of combined triumph and disappointment), when we have to decide whether to accept a work of art that we have to admit we weren’t in control of as we made it and of which we’re not entirely sure we approve. It is less than we wanted it to be, and yet it is more, too."  -- can you guess???  

I love all these quotes, but especially the first. What does it look like to choose what I like over and over again. I think that's why I like this space, this blog. Because it's a spot where I don't have to worry about what others are thinking at all. It's totally an independent space. It's *technically* public, and maybe one day I'll want it to be more public, but for now, it's enough of a discomfort to have *something* that's out in the real world that I chose. 

The other thing I was struggling with this week is... is it so, so dumb to try to grow an audience on instagram? I'm pretty conflicted about it. There's a bunch of issues. Some of them are ethical! What does it mean to be a part of something that I know is a bit insidious? At the same time, isn't this the best place to find an audience? To be magically *discovered*. I think what I'm landing on (and I'm flying and I'm landing and I'm talking and writing and doing this all at the same time), is that the things I make shouldn't be so, so, so tied to instagram. Does that make sense? They should be able to live... wherever. Or they should have a home outside of just the thing that I'm building on IG. Maybe that means that the shortform content should also live on YouTube. Or also *could* live on YouTube. You know what I mean? Like... is it dumb outside of the context of an IG reel? Then maybe don't make it. In that way, the thing you're making becomes more resilient.  

Last note: I *did* feel the feeling. The 'ah hell yes' feeling. I don't have the video that I saw, but there was this video... and it was a bit cheesy even. It had some of the ole: "I can't believe I'm actually here right now... 5 years later... selling ART that I PAINT" It's like... okay we get it... very cool... 

But they talked about growing the sense of belief that they were an artist and that they were... I don't know... on the right path. On the way to becoming who they were going to be: a successful painter. And then that, over the course of the first 6 months or so, they just had to convince themselves of this fact. To embody that feeling of faith and belief. And I felt that over the past week, two weeks. It... went away at times haha. But I do think that's sort of a meta goal of this whole thing. To convince myself that there _is_ a way forward.
