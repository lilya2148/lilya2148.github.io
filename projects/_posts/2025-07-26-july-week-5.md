✅ choose one type of post that will take 30 - 120 minutes to make, and one that takes, like 5 minutes to make (posts that aren't that funny)  
✅ Make a list of advice to a pianist, a standup comedian, a writer

✅ make 10 short funnies - review the list of types, decide a type that will take you less than 5 minutes to make  
:gem: make 10 short sentimental posts - review the list of types, decide a type that will take you less than 5 minutes to make  


### What are you hoping for
Thinking about G.W.'s advice, I need more clarity on what I want to accomplish. I need more faith that I can do the things that I set out to do. And last... I need more action. I hope I can make 10 posts. And start to give myself some of this ^^. Overall? I want to know what I'm signing up for here, and how *I* know that I'm on the right path. 

### Review
Good week! Hit the output goals! Glad you did 10 short funnies and 10 short sentimentals... I think those were even... add ons from the original plan. :gem: I think is how we could mark those haha
