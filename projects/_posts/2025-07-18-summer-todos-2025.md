Preeety good. We didn't write for a ton this week... Total hours? 5h 20min. To take me to 15h 30 for the month. It's the 19th, and we've got 9 weekdays left. So I need to write on average, like... 1 hour and 40 minutes on those days. We can do that! I still feel like I'm putting off the most important work, so I want to just kill and essay and a humor piece next week so that I'm sure I'm hitting my goals. This week, I made two blog posts (one on writing rules for me, and one on social media... and I also started the one that was like the quarterly review and all that). So yeah - i mean... we're posting on this blog a lot, which I guess is cool!

My hope for this week is that I hit send on two things I've been working on for a while. It's a short todo list, and I'm going to try to write for 10 hours, so these things hopefully? Get done early in the week. We'll see!
