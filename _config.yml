# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  It costs $5 to go to this site and read any of the content. You know 
  when you pull up to an abandoned campsite with a sign that says please 
  register your car and there's a little box for you to write your license 
  plate and drop $5-40 dollars in? That's what this is. This is a little wooden box.
  Please donate. Come on. You're thinking about it. 
  
  Just kidding ha, ha and sorry for even joking about that! I'm just glad you're here!
  On a blog! Look at us ha, ha. Can I get you anything? Sparkling water perhaps? 
  A car? Can I get you a car? I'll look into it. Anyway, no need to pay!!
