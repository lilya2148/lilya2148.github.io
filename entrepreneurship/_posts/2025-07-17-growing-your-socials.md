Alright - I don't think this is going to be very long, but I do want to call out a post from a creator that was very helpful. I'm pinning the post here ([Here’s what I’d do if were growing my IG account from 0 in 2025](https://www.instagram.com/p/DLz0hiFtRQZ/?igsh=MWN4Y2w4ejhhbWYwZw%3D%3D)) because I'll probably come back to it!

This post - in addition to having some _siiiick_ hooks (i.e. the title) had a lot of resources in the slides. The main takeaways for me were:
1) define your one sentence brand... bc it should be really clear what you're doing when someone lands on your page... 
2) pick one format to get really good at
3) be loved by 10 before being seen by 10k (this is pretty much a direct quote! I thought it was awesome and really helpful!)
4) post often and consistently (she recommended 2-3x per week for 90 days)
5) remix the posts that do really well - change formats, make a part 2, etc
6) do a recurring series
7) Manually build community (polls, dms, comments)

I feel like the one that's always hard for me is the "brand in one sentence" ... that's not easy when you're doing like artsy-fartsy stuff, right... but the other ones I think _are_ really good advice.
