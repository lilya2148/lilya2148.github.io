Alright - I don't think this is going to be very long, but I do want to call out a post from a creator that was very helpful. I'm pinning the post here ([Here’s what I’d do if were growing my IG account from 0 in 2025](https://www.instagram.com/p/DLz0hiFtRQZ/?igsh=MWN4Y2w4ejhhbWYwZw%3D%3D)) because I'll probably come back to it.

This post - in addition to having some _siiiick_ hooks (i.e. the title) had a lot of resources in the slides. The main takeaways for me were:

### 1) pick one format to get really good at
Make it easy on yourself! I feel like I see this advice a bunch... find something that you can just crank out if you need to. Find a form that's easy to make. Then? Make it really freaking good. Reminds me of [this really good video on drawing 1000 ibises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6NsEDwHHiE). 

This advice is calling for another type of niching down, but instead of niching on content, it's niching on form. Which... I guess is a part of content. The whole point, I think, is that you're (hopefully) going to be creating a lot, so you might as well get comfortable with the form. 

### 2) post consistently 
This person recommended 2-3x per week for 90 days, which I liked. Hormozi, internet field, says you should do 100 in 100 days. Gary V says once a day for a year. Whatever your number is - sounds like you've got to post a decent amount in order to get a following and in order for the ALGORITHM to deem you worthy. 

Note: I've only gone viral once, and it was at the end of a challenge to post 70 times in 3 months. Literally it was like the last post that I made to get to 70, and I posted like 5 times in a day because I was like, "Gotta get to 70." 

Obviously, the fear here is "What if I don't have anything to post!? What if I run out of ideas?" For me, I usually find that if I'm in a habit of making, and if I'm choosing a form that I'm comfy with, it's really easy to pump out a bunch of ideas. Then, I'll actually get overwhelmed by the amount of ideas, and starting thinking what if all these ideas are dumb?? What if they're not good enough? But that's a whole different problem, and you're going to get better by doing more, so.... just do it. 

### 3) remix the posts that do really well
Yeah - some of the shit you post is going to do really well. 

Some of it is going to be bad. 

Some of it's going to be good. 

Some of it is going to be something that you thought was good, but is actually bad. Some of it's going to be shit you thought was okay, and turned out to be really good. 

But if you're making a lot, you're *going* to make something good, and when that happens, flag it and try to double down on it. Share it in stories, pin it, make a part 2, make it into a reel... If it's a meme, meme on it. Also do the analysis - why is this good? Why did people like this? Can I make something similar that people will also like? 

### 4) do a recurring series
Recurring series give YOU a form to create consistently, and they give your audience something to come back to. It's a tactic for building community and for helping you create often. 

### 5) Manually build community (polls, dms, comments)
Get out your CTAs people! No, don't do that, but you do want REAL, people-to-people interaction with your page. You don't want just the scroll and roll-- where they scroll by you and then roll over and go to bed without thinking about you ever again. 

### 6) be loved by 10 before being seen by 10k 
Okay this is like preettty much a direct quote! I thought it was awesome and really helpful! Reminds me of [1000 true fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/) by Kevin Kelly. THis idea is helpful for two reasons... One, it reminds me that building a following (a true following!) is slow, arduous work (right?) Two, its like... get your brand together! Do what you want to do without being so tied up in viralty. Some people will come. That's great! Focus on that! Three - and yeah I'm going to push into previously unmentioned reason 3 - it puts the focus back on the work, and takes it away from the "work" of getting a following. 

### 7) define your one sentence brand... 
It should be really clear what you're doing when someone lands on your page... I feel like everyone says this, and I always struggle with it... not easy when you're doing like artsy-fartsy stuff, right? Alas, even if it's super vague, or Ross Gayian like "I'm going to write a book of delights" at least you know what you're working on, and other people know what you're working on. 

### 8) Follow Your Heros
This one's mine, but I think it's helpful, so I'm adding it. Pick the 2-10 people who's "work" you're super jealous of. You wish you had their account. They're making stuff that's total fire. It's insane. They're making like, totally dope shit right now. UGH if you could just BE them. Make a list of those people. Define what you would say THEIR one sentence brand is. Look at their form. Reach out and say you love their work. Okay, now try to look at YOUR brand and YOUR form, and make it an amalgamation of what all those folks are doing.
