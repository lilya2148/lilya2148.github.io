Alright - I don't think this is going to be very long, but I do want to call out a post from a creator that was very helpful. I'm pinning the post here ([Here’s what I’d do if were growing my IG account from 0 in 2025](https://www.instagram.com/p/DLz0hiFtRQZ/?igsh=MWN4Y2w4ejhhbWYwZw%3D%3D)) because I'll probably come back to it.

This post - in addition to having some _siiiick_ hooks (i.e. the title) had a lot of resources in the slides. The main takeaways for me were:

### 1) pick one format to get really good at
Make it easy on yourself! I feel like I see this advice a bunch... find something that you can just crank out if you need to. Find a form that is easy to make. Then? Make it really freaking good. Reminds me of [this really good video on drawing 1000 ibises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6NsEDwHHiE). It's another form of niching down, but instead of niching on content, it's niching on form. Which... I guess is a part of content. The whole point, I think, is that you're (hopefully) going to be creating a lot, so you might as well get comfortable with the form. 

### 2) post consistently 
She recommended 2-3x per week for 90 days, which I liked. Hormozi, internet field, says you should do 100 in 100 days. Gary V says 1x per year for a year. But - whatever your number is - it seems like you've got to post a decent amount in order to get a following and in order for the ALGORITHM to deem you worthy. 

Obviously, the fear here is "What if I don't have anything to post!? What if I run out of ideas?" For me, I usually find that if I'm in a habit of making, and if I'm choosing a form that I'm comfy with, it's really easy to pump out a bunch of ideas. Then, I'll actually get overwhelmed by the amount of ideas, and starting thinking what if all these ideas are dumb?? What if they're not good enough? But that's a whole different problem, and you're going to get good, by doing more, so.... post consistently? 

### 3) remix the posts that do really well - change formats, make a part 2, etc
Yeah - some of the shit you post is going to do really well. Some of it is going to be bad. Some of it's going to be good. Some of it is going to be something that you thought was good, but is actually bad. Some of it's going to be shit you thought was okay, and turned out to be really good. 

But IF you're making a lot, you're *going* to make something good, and when that happens, flag it and try to double down on it. Share it in stories, pin it, make a part 2, make it into a reel... If it's a meme, meme on it. Also do the analysis - why is this good? Why did people like this? Can I make something similar that people will also like? 

### 4) do a recurring series
Recurring series give YOU a form to create consistently, and they give your audience something to come back to. It's a tactic for building community and for helping you create often. 

### 5) Manually build community (polls, dms, comments)
Get out your CTAs people! No, don't do that, but you do want REAL people to people interaction with your page. You don't want just the scroll and roll-- where they scroll by you and then roll over and go to bed without thinking about you ever again. 

### 6) be loved by 10 before being seen by 10k 
Okay this is like preettty (this is pretty much a direct quote! I thought it was awesome and really helpful!) Reminds me of [1000 true fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/) by Kevin Kelly. I think this is probably really helpful for two reasons... One, it reminds me that building a following (a true following!) is slow, arduous work (right?) Two, its like... get your brand together! Do what you want to do without being so tied up in viralty. Some people will come. That's great! Focus on that! Three - and yeah I'm going to push into previously unmentioned reason 3 - it puts the focus back on the work, and takes it away from the "work" of getting a following. 

### 7) define your one sentence brand... 
bc it should be really clear what you're doing when someone lands on your page... I feel like everyone says this, and I always struggle with it... not easy when you're doing like artsy-fartsy stuff, right? Alas, even if it's super vague, or Ross Gayian like "I'm going to write a book of delights" at least you know what you're working on, and other people know what you're working on. 

### 8) 
I'll add my own here!
