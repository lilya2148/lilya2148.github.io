Alright - I don't think this is going to be very long, but I do want to call out a post from a creator that was very helpful. I'm pinning the post here ([Here’s what I’d do if were growing my IG account from 0 in 2025](https://www.instagram.com/p/DLz0hiFtRQZ/?igsh=MWN4Y2w4ejhhbWYwZw%3D%3D)) because I'll probably come back to it!

This post - in addition to having some _siiiick_ hooks (i.e. the title) had a lot of resources in the slides. The main takeaways for me were:

## 2) pick one format to get really good at
Another form of niching down. But for sure! Helpful if you're going to be mass producing posts, which brings us to... 


## 3) post often and consistently (she recommended 2-3x per week for 90 days)
Yeaaaah no getting around this one eh? For me, staying consistent is basically impossible, so what I'm shooting for is to set up a buffer account and just, once a week, schedule 10 posts. My fear is that one day I won't have anything to post. Alas, hopefully during the rest of the week I can work on creating posts... but is that really waht I'm doing here? Just making a buuunnch of instagram posts?? What about the longer form stuff. I feel like people have told me to shift to longer form stuff?! 

I think my solution here (and I'm just coming up with it on the spot, so don't kill me) is to yes, do longer form stuff and have a slightly large focus be on that. To use longer form in the short form (i.e. essays on IG). And to have a really quick and dirty way to make a bunch of posts REALLY fast. 

5) remix the posts that do really well - change formats, make a part 2, etc

6) do a recurring series

7) Manually build community (polls, dms, comments)

## 4) be loved by 10 before being seen by 10k 
Okay this is like preettty (this is pretty much a direct quote! I thought it was awesome and really helpful!)

 
## 1) define your one sentence brand... 
bc it should be really clear what you're doing when someone lands on your page... I feel like everyone says this, and I always struggle with it... not easy when you're doing like artsy-fartsy stuff, right? Alas, even if it's super vague, or Ross Gayian like "I'm going to write a book of delights" at least you know what you're working on, and other people know what you're working on.
