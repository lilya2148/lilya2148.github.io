Alrighht. This will be interesting. 

Lol can you imagine - the most like, timid writer of all time, just starting everything off like that. 

"This will be interesting. I promise. Read on - why? It'll be interesting."

## 1) Soup Kitchen Coordinator 
My first job, ah! The nostalgia. Didn't make much money here. Idk why this would (ever?) be included in someone's blog about how to make $$ as an entrepreneur, but alas, these are my roots. 

**Was it fun?** 
yes? not really, but sort of? Like it was fun to be around all the volunteers, and all my coworkers. Everyone there was there for a really good reason. So that was cool. 

**Did I make money?** 
yes? but not really. Like, $200 a month and free housing. Definitely a volunteering program. 

**Things I learned**
1) So much inefficiency! - Literally once we had volunteers move cloths from one area to another, and then the next set of volunteers we had them move the clothes back. What!?!?! We also straight up denied a school teacher all the bread his students made for the soup kitchen (should have called ahead! We don't really take bread, buddy!). I'd just spent an hour throwing away the 3-4 bins of moldy bread we had, washing the bins, and reloading it with bread that wasn't moldy. And then this guy showed up. 

2) It's not all about efficiency... - ugh... the most useful thing I think I did here was go to the hospital with one of guests, who had to get her big toe amputated because she had diabetes and nerve damage in her toe and didn't feel that it was rotting / super infected. 


## 2) stand up 
Tecchhnically didn't make any money here. I went 14 times, and I definitely was getting better! It was a total grind though. Often times you had to wait 2 hours to get 5 minutes of stage time, and sometimes that was just to perform in front of comics who were depressed bc they just bombed. 

**Closest I came to making money:** 
I had a single good set where someone asked if I had 10 minutes of material. Apparenetly I too eagerly said, uh what yes yes yes I do yes please, because he was like "No you don't!" But I feel like if I just cooly nodded... maybe he would have given me one of the paid 10 minute slots

**Thing I'd do differently:** Find a mic or two just to practice / workshop jokes, practice for friends & family, and then just go to an actually good and fun open mic with a real audience and not just comics.  

## 3) (Freelance) Reporter / Writer / Poet?! / Humorist
NGL this one was pretty rough haha. It was so much work, both to write the piece, and to pitch people to get the article. I would roughly get like, 1 pitch accpeted out of 20 sent out. For me, too, it took me like an hour minimum to think of and write a good pitch. Each accepted pitch was usually to write a 1-2k piece (4-8 hours to write), and would pay about $200 (in three months*). All in all, it would take me about 28 hours to get $200-300 (realistically, you'd get paid in a month).

All that said, this was a hard one to do and *expect* to make a living on. I think it'd take a couple months of building up a pipeline / habit (where you're losing $$ every month) to do this effectively.

The times where it did feel cool / worth it / fun were either when I got paid well (one place paid me $800 for an essay! soemthing that I'd written just for fun!) or I didn't expect to get paid or published at all (made $50 for a poem, what?)

**Things I'd do differently** 
- only pitch things I really really wanted to write
- not rely on it for a primary source of income
- target high-paying or high-leverage pubs. One pub paid me $800 for an essay. Now that was wroth it! Other pubs, like the New York Times, The New Yorker, New -- anything with New York in the title -- will give you credibility as a writer. Depending on your goals, I think it does make sense to try to get published at these places.

**Did I have fun?** 

not... really

**Was it meaningful?** 

Sort of! I wrote two pieces about people living on the street in Seattle. Both of these were really important and impactful for me personally. 

## 4) Musician - 
Idk if I can even really say that I tried to do this. I busked like one time. But we did it. It was pretty embarassing, I got a note wrong on like silent night and left haha. 

## 6) Data Engineer 
ahhh the "real" jobs. These were the jobs that made me money while I was trying to decide what to do. Definitely made money here, lol. But it was classic: cog in a machine, whatever work that I'd end up spending my whole life on by accident. 

## 7) Freelance Developer
This one was cool! I got one contract where I was paid pretty well, and the people I worked with were cool. This was the first time I felt like I actually liked coding. I spent hours and hours making an app, and it turned out pretty good! I'd never made an app before, so it was all hands on deck, and we went real fast. I loved the flexibility, freedom, and ownership I felt while working, and this is something where - if the projects just kept coming, I would keep doing it. 

Alas, a big part of freelancing is getting the work, and that's the part that I wasn't good at and honestly, didn't even think that I'd have to do... What?! Looking back it seems so stupid. Of course you're going to have to get work!! Ugh. The first gig I got was from a co-worker. After that, I got another contract from a friend, but all in all, I just wasn't able to spend enough time developing *AND* getting future work. 

**If I were going to do it again**

I'd want a better plan of a) how the freak am I going to get ocntracts. Literally, what am I going to try to do to get people to pay me to code. And b) have a backup plan if the projects didn't come in for a couple months. 

I'd also spend some time putting together a website / portfolio and maybe connect that to a social media account where I did lil coding projects on the side. Could be fun! 

## 8) General Manager for a sports team 
yeaaaah pretty much the coolest job I ever had. Kind of. I was the do-it-all guy, including the camp counselor for our sports camps. It was fun, but a lot of work, and it did not pay much. I had this job when I was tanking after the freelance biz was slowly dying, so it was good to just make ends meet. But ultimately it was so much work, and I wasn't getting paid very much. Pretty quickly needed to eject out of this one to find a higher paying job. 

## 9) Online course teacher 
ughhhh is it possible to get more cringy than this? I literally tried to do this. I tried to sell a freelance writing course. After taking a freelance writing course. 

**Things I learned:** 
1) it felt really cringy and gross to email everyone that I had an email for
2) no one bought it or even came close to buying it. You can set up a funnel in 24 hours with a landing page and a site and everything and no one m

## 10) Deli man - 
I worked at a deli during the pandemic, after I left my job in consulting. 

## 11) Uber Eats




*kidding!**
