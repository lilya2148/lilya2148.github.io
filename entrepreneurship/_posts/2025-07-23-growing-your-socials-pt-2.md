Alright - and yes, I agree, I probably shouldn't start a blog post with alright.

I read the post that I posted - what a masterbatory activity, I'm the only one reading my blog. I read my blog then I write about it what the FUCK dude haha. 

But I do think it would be helpful to implement the strategies in [growing your socials](https://lilya2148.github.io/entrepreneurship/2025/07/17/growing-your-socials.html). Just to walk it out. Make a todo list. Do it. 

I have a number of socials... I have my personal socials, including a substack that I sort of orphaned. Then I have two other "streams" or personas? That I made because I heard you had to niche down. No one wants to see a poem about grass next to a poopy-dick joke, so yeah, I split those accounts up. 

To be super explicit... The personas are (this is the first I've ever written / defined them... ah! scary!)... The first one is just funny. I'm just trying to make funny stuff. It's not that specific and I don't know if it has to be. It's not lotr memes; I feel like I have to make a brand of funny first? But I'm not sure. The next one is like essays and shit. It's more touchy feely. For both, I have a substack and an instagram. As of today? My funny instagram has 918 followers, and my sentimental instagram has 0. Both substacks have 0 followers. So... you've got me at pretty much the beginning! Which is cool. 

"918 followers isn't the beginning!!! You're basically Mr. Beast!" Lol. Can't even stay with that thought for another second it's so dumb. I made a challenge for myself to post 70x in 90 days. On day 90, I still had maybe < 15 followers and my reel / post that got the most likes was at like... 1000 likes. Sooo not that good. I posted a bunch to get me to 90... I want to say I made 5 posts in like 10 minutes, and one of them went... viral? It got 3.3M views and 96k likes. So that's cool. That's cool in a way. Literally the only followers I got were from that video. The most I got up to was 1000, and then people started leaving after that. 

Anyway... I these are the todos: 
- [ ] Save 20-100 reels that you admire; that are doing the thing that you want to do 
- [ ] Write those down somewhere. Categorize the posts in a way. Also save / write down the creator profiles. 
- [ ] After looking through all the profiles, create a 1 sentence brand so it's clear who your page is for. 
- [ ] Set up a buffer account to schedule posts 
- [ ] Looking at the posts that you admire / liked, figure out what kind of formats you could try
- [ ] Outline the types of posts you are going to do. Create a document that shows where each type of post goes to, and where (which platform and within the platform) it goes. 
- [ ] Somewhere... create a folder or file naming system for each type of post (funny-post-insta.jpeg, funny-story-insta.jpeg, ... something like that). Identify the buckets that each post will fall into. And find a way to name them so it's easy to schedule in buffer. 
- [ ] get writing! get posting! 
- [ ] when you schedule and/or post... put it down somewhere so that you can see you're posting, you can see the day, etc etc
