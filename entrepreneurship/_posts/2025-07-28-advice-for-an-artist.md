1. Define your goals. Are you going to be successful once your work is put out into the world like Rick Reuben says you are? What does success look like for you. Define your path. 
2. Master the art of showing up. Do something every day. 
3. Dedicate yourself to the craft of making the thing you said you are going to make. Remember that the more you focus your efforts, the more improvement you'll see. 
4. Take heart! And enjoy. 
5. "Write down all your fears, your flaws, your insecurities, the guilt, the pressures. Look at 'em on a list. Know they're all distractions." -- Pharrell Williams
